    <h2 id="Definition">What is Index Funds?</h2>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing-in-index-funds-4771002">Investopedia,</a> an index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a portfolio constructed to match or track the components of a financial market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). An index mutual fund is said to provide broad market exposure, low operating expenses, and low portfolio turnover. These funds follow their benchmark index regardless of the state of the markets. Index funds are generally considered ideal core portfolio holdings for retirement accounts, such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) accounts. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has recommended index funds as a haven for savings for the later years of life. Rather than picking out individual stocks for investment, he has said, it makes more sense for the average investor to buy all of the S&P 500 companies at the low cost that an index fund offers.</p>

    <h2 id="Discover_Indexes">Where to find Index funds</h2>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/how-to-buy-index-funds/" >Forbes Advisor</a> Indexes to start your search with include;
        <ul>
        <li>Broad market indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 Index, NASDAQ and Wilshire 5000 Index. Funds tracking one of these core indexes are commonly chosen by those looking to construct simple two- or three-fund portfolios.</li>
        <li>Equity indexes that group companies by size like the Russell 3000 Index (large-cap companies), Russell 2000 Index (small-cap companies) and S&P 400 Index (mid-cap companies). Generally, the smaller the companies in an index, the more risk and growth potential you take on.</li>
        <li>Indexes offering exposure to stocks from companies outside of the U.S., like the MSCI Indexes. Usually, the less developed a country’s economy, the more risk and growth potential you take on.</li>
        <li>Indexes based in the bond and fixed income markets, such as the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index. Indexes with corporate bonds typically offer higher returns (and more risk) than those that only invest in government bonds.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2 id="How-to">How to invest in Index Funds</h2>
    <p> Investing in index funds is easy. Here's a quick rundown from <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/how-to-invest-in-index-funds">NerdWallet</a> about how to do it:
      <ul> <li>Decide where to buy your index funds. You can purchase an index fund directly from a mutual fund company or a brokerage. Same goes for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are like mini mutual funds that trade like stocks throughout the day.</li>
        
    <li>Consider Fund selection. Do you want to purchase index funds from various fund families? The big mutual fund companies carry some of their competitors’ funds, but the selection may be more limited than what’s available in a discount broker’s lineup.</li>
        
<li>Consider Convenience. Find a single provider who can accommodate all your needs. For example, if you’re just going to invest in mutual funds (or even a mix of funds and stocks), a mutual fund company may be able to serve as your investment hub. But if you require sophisticated stock research and screening tools, a discount broker that also sells the index funds you want may be better.<a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-is-how-to-open-brokerage-account"> (If you don't have a brokerage account, here's how to open one.)</a></li>
        
    <li>Consider Trading costs. If the commission or transaction fee isn’t waived, consider how much a broker or fund company charges to buy or sell the index fund. Mutual fund commissions are higher than stock trading ones, about $20 or more, compared with less than $10 a trade for stocks and ETFs.</li>
        
        <li>Consider Impact investing. Want your investment to make a difference outside your portfolio? Some index funds track benchmarks that target companies with a focus on environmental or social justice causes. Learn more about impact investing.</li>
        
            <li>Consider Commission-free options. Do they offer no-transaction-fee mutual funds or commission-free ETFs? This is an important criterion we use to rate discount brokers.</li>
        
    <li>Buy the index funds.</li>
        In order to purchase shares of an index fund, you'll need to do so from an investment account. You can then open an investment account, such as a traditional brokerage account or a Roth IRA, through the brokerage you picked. You can then buy the fund from that account.
        
        When you go to purchase the fund, you may be able to select a fixed dollar amount to spend or choose a number of shares. The share price of the index fund, and your investing budget, will likely determine how much you're willing to spend. For instance, if you have $1,000 you'd like to invest in an index fund, and the fund you're looking at is selling for $100 a share, you'd be able to purchase 10 shares.</p>
